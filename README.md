# Multiplayer Tower Defense Game

Inspired by the likes of Dungeon Defenders and Orcs Must Die, my two teammates and I created a third person shooter tower defense game in multiplayer with Unity
as a part of our integration project for our final semester in computer science and mathematics at Coll√®ge Lionel-Groulx.

# What I Learned

* Developed a vector system coupled with the use of Unity environment layers to make a third person camera
* Added visual effects to menus with the use of OnMouseEnter/OnMouseExit
* Developed a weapon switching system
* Learned about the UNEt multiplayer system, was a bigger difficulty than anticipated, all the client players have stats glitches
